# Hand Detection & Tracking : Using opencv-mediapipe
This repository shows how to detect Hands using OpenCV and MediaPipe Solutions

The repository has 3 files :

1. HandTracking.py : is a basic file where the actual code is written using OpenCV & mediapipe.solutions.hands

2. HandTrackingModule.py : converts the above basic file into a module, so that this module can be used for further projects.

3. Main.py : This is the final file which uses the above Module, and returns the output

### The final output contains the list of ID, and their pixel locations, which can be used in future projects
